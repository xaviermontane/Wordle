The popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) right from your terminal!

## What is Wordle?
Written in Python, this copy of the game recreates the acclaimed word game.<br>

The objective of the game is to guess the Wordle in 6 tries.<br>
Depending on the accuracy of your guess, the terminal output will display how close your guess was to the word.<br>


**Do you think you can guess the word before running out of lives?**<br>

### Symbols:

__`√`__ means the word is in the correct spot.

__`≈`__ means the word is correct but in the wrong spot.

__`X`__ means the word is not in any spot.
